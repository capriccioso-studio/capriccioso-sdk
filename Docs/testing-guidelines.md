## Test types

We **use unit tests and integration tests**. Every non-trivial code deserves a test. Commonly, when appropriate, we create both unit tests, for testing functionality of small separated parts, and integration tests to test how the code behaves in the context of other components. We use `xUnit` testing framework and `Moq` for mocking.
